class PalmNutGnawModel:
    """
    Taphonomic model to estimate the fraction of shell fragments without rat gnawing evidence
    based on hole size, fragmentation patterns, and geometric constraints.
    
    This model addresses the archaeological interpretation problem on Rapa Nui where
    the absence of gnaw marks on some palm nut shell fragments has been used to argue
    against rat predation impacts. The model demonstrates that post-depositional
    fragmentation creates systematic bias toward loss of gnaw mark evidence.
    
    Key assumptions:
    - Rat gnaw holes are approximately circular and occupy a known fraction of shell surface
    - Gnaw marks only occur along hole edges (not throughout the entire hole)
    - Post-depositional fragmentation is approximately random
    - Shell fragments preserve proportionally to their size

        Initialize model parameters based on Rapa Nui palm nut characteristics.
        
        Parameters:
        hole_fraction (float): Fraction of shell surface area occupied by gnaw hole.
                              Default 0.20 (20%) based on user's estimate of rat gnaw holes.
                              This represents the area where gnaw marks could potentially
                              be preserved, not the entire gnawed area.
        shell_radius (float): Normalized shell radius (default 1.0 for mathematical convenience).
                             The model scales to any actual shell size.
        
        Archaeological rationale:
        The hole_fraction parameter is critical because it represents the only area where
        gnaw marks can be preserved. Rats create holes to access the seed interior, and
        gnaw marks are only visible along the edges of these holes. The remaining 80%
        of the shell surface will never show gnaw marks regardless of predation intensity.

    def simple_probability_model(self):
        """
        Baseline probability model assuming random fragmentation and uniform fragment distribution.
        
        Mathematical reasoning:
        If gnaw marks occupy a fraction 'h' of the shell surface, then under random fragmentation,
        the probability that any given fragment intersects with the gnawed area is approximately 'h'.
        Therefore, the probability that a fragment lacks gnaw marks is (1 - h).
        
        This represents the theoretical minimum percentage of fragments without gnaw marks,
        assuming optimal conditions for gnaw mark preservation (large fragments, perfect preservation).
        
        Archaeological interpretation:
        Even this simplest model predicts that the majority of fragments (80% with h=0.20)
        would lack gnaw marks. This baseline demonstrates that the absence of gnaw marks
        on most fragments is expected, not evidence against predation.

        """
        Advanced model accounting for fragment size distribution and overlap probabilities.
        
        This model recognizes that the probability of a fragment containing gnaw marks
        depends on both the fragment size and the gnaw hole size. Larger fragments
        are more likely to intersect with the gnawed area than smaller fragments.
        
        Mathematical approach:
        1. Generate realistic fragment size distribution (log-normal, typical of natural fracture)
        2. For each fragment, calculate probability of overlap with gnaw hole
        3. Use approximation: P(overlap) ≈ min(1, (fragment_area + hole_area) / total_area)
        4. Monte Carlo simulation accounts for stochastic fragmentation processes
        
        Taphonomic considerations:
        - Fragment size distribution follows log-normal pattern (common in geological processes)
        - Coefficient of variation reflects natural variability in breakage patterns
        - Larger fragments have higher probability of preserving gnaw marks
        - Model captures the geometric relationship between fragment and hole sizes
        
        Archaeological significance:
        This model provides more realistic predictions by acknowledging that smaller
        fragments (which are more common in archaeological contexts due to trampling,
        sediment loading, etc.) are less likely to preserve gnaw mark evidence.
        
        Parameters:
        mean_fragment_area (float): Mean fragment surface area as fraction of total shell.
                                   Typical values: 0.01-0.20 (1%-20% of original shell)
        fragment_area_cv (float): Coefficient of variation for fragment size distribution.
                                 Default 0.5 reflects moderate variability in breakage patterns.

        The approach projects the 3D shell surface onto a 2D plane for computational
        efficiency while maintaining geometric accuracy.
        
        Mathematical framework:
        1. Project spherical shell surface to 2D circle (area-preserving transformation)
        2. Model gnaw hole as circular area within the projected shell
        3. Generate random fragment locations using realistic spatial distribution
        4. Calculate explicit geometric overlap between fragments and gnaw hole
        5. Account for fragment size variability and spatial clustering
        
        Geometric considerations:
        - Random hole placement simulates unknown gnaw location relative to breakage
        - Fragment centers follow uniform distribution within shell boundary
        - Overlap detection uses Euclidean distance between fragment and hole centers
        - Fragments modeled as circular areas for computational simplicity
        
        Taphonomic realism:
        - Accounts for spatial correlation between fracture patterns and hole location
        - Models realistic fragment size distribution based on area constraints
        - Incorporates stochastic elements reflecting natural fragmentation processes
        - Provides uncertainty estimates through Monte Carlo approach

        This model best represents actual archaeological preservation scenarios where:

        - Multiple fragments may derive from different areas of the same shell
        - Post-depositional processes (trampling, bioturbation) randomize spatial relationships

        Analytical approximation for overlapping circular areas on a spherical surface.
        
        This method provides a quick analytical estimate without Monte Carlo simulation,
        useful for rapid parameter exploration and sensitivity analysis. The approach
        uses geometric probability theory for overlapping circles on a sphere.
        
        Mathematical foundation:
        For two circular areas (fragment and hole) on a spherical surface, the probability
        of overlap can be approximated using the inclusion-exclusion principle:
        P(overlap) ≈ (A_hole + A_fragment + 2√(A_hole × A_fragment)) / A_total
        
        The additional term 2√(A_hole × A_fragment) accounts for the geometric correlation
        between overlapping circular areas, providing a better approximation than simple
        addition of areas.
        
        Limitations:
        - Assumes fragments and holes are circular (simplification)
        - Ignores edge effects near shell boundaries
        - Does not account for fragment size distribution
        - Provides deterministic rather than stochastic estimates

    Main execution block for palm nut taphonomy analysis.
    
    This script addresses a specific archaeological controversy on Rapa Nui (Easter Island)
    regarding the interpretation of palm nut shell fragments in the archaeological record.
    Some researchers have argued against rat predation impacts based on the presence of
    shell fragments without visible gnaw marks. This analysis demonstrates that such
    arguments represent a fundamental misunderstanding of taphonomic processes.
    
    Scientific contribution:
    1. Quantifies preservation bias in gnaw mark evidence
    2. Provides mathematical framework for taphonomic interpretation
    3. Demonstrates robustness of conclusions across parameter uncertainty
    4. Offers methodological guidance for similar archaeological problems
    
    Archaeological significance:
    The results strongly support the hypothesis that introduced rats significantly
    impacted palm regeneration on Rapa Nui, contrary to arguments based on simplistic
    interpretation of fragment assemblages without consideration of taphonomic bias.
    
    Usage:
    Run this script to generate complete analysis including:
    - Model predictions under different scenarios
    - Sensitivity analysis across parameter ranges
    - Visualization of key results
    - Archaeological interpretation framework
